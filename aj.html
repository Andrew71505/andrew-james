<br>
<h3 style="font-family:comic sans;">
In Western astrology, and formerly astronomy, the zodiac is divided into twelve signs, each occupying 30Â° of celestial longitude and roughly corresponding to the star constellations: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces.
To know your horoscope, check which one of the 12 zodiac signs your birthday is in. Once you know your star sign, look at a daily newspaper or online publication to get your horoscope.

They are ruled by the planet Mercury, and so they are never happier than when they are sharing their ideas and communicating with the people around them. They enjoy chit-chat and tend to have expression and communication very high on their list of priorities. Sometimes their love for sharing themselves with others, and their never-ending list of ideas can make them seem nervous, excited, and sometimes even manic.

<a name="Cancer">CANCER</a>

Those born under the Virgo zodiac sign have capable, organized and analytical minds, which often makes them a pleasure to chat with.

<p align="justify">
The zodiac sign Libra is thrives when their needs of balance, justice, and stability are met. They are charming creatures that somehow always surround themselves with a sense of beauty and harmony. Admittedly, some of them can go to extremes searching for that harmony - which can make their situations unreasonable or unhealthy. Their ruling planet is Venus meaning that Libras are nurturing, caring, and they can make great defenders of the downtrodden. Sometimes, they can be shy if they find difficulties in coming out of their shell and letting their guard down. Despite their more introverted side they still love a good debate.

<p align="justify">
Unfortunately, those born under the Scorpio zodiac sign are often misunderstood. They are quite bold, with intense personalities and feelings that hide underneath their cool exterior. They are capable people that can complete great and massive projects with control and confidence. Their intensity when approaching a situation means that they can surmount almost all obstacles if they can truly put their mind to the task. Many Scorpios have an unshakable focus when they need to call on it. However, they are often secretive, seeming withdrawn and uninterested, when they are actually keenly observing.

<a name="Sagittarius">SAGITTARIUS</a>

<p align="justify">
The Sagittarius zodiac sign often gains the reputation of the philosopher among their fellow zodiac signs. They do have a great ability to focus, but this may be surprising since many of them love exploring and wandering the world, tasting all the pleasures of life. From an early age, they must learn how to channel their energy or else they risk stretching themselves out too thin going in too many directions. They often are hasty individuals and lack patience. When they encounter failure they can sometimes make a sudden comeback, much to the surprise of others. While they are loyal friends, they may find it hard to commit as this can run counter to their desire for freedom and expansion. 
</p>
<br><br><br>
<a name="Capricorn">CAPRICORN</a>
<br>
<img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/vectors/capricorn-zodiac-sign-vector-id1223318606?k=20&m=1223318606&s=612x612&w=0&h=bbztirRWsGSeKpaTH4S1zBKRDywbMOrnqc0XxL3aybo=" width="500">
<p align="justify">
Those born under the Capricorn zodiac sign are talented at applying their keen intelligence and ambition to practical matters.  Stability and order are important to them - and this makes them good organizers. Their goals are often lofty, and they achieve them slowly - but purposefully, and systematically. They are gifted with a sharp intuition, although they can be rather secretive about what they perceive. They are patient with themselves - they have confidence that they can accomplish all their goals if they follow their step-by-step plan. They are responsible people that often take the heavy burden of others - whether willingly, or just because they are so capable. However, they find it difficult to share their own troubles and can struggle with depression if they don't learn how to express their feelings. 
</p>
<br><br><br>
<a name="Aquarius">AQUARIUS</a>
<br>
<img src="https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/002/094/796/original/aquarius-zodiac-sign-icons-vector.jpg" width="500">
<p align="justify">
Aquarius often comes off as an oddball - they have quirky personalities and quietly go about accomplishing their goals in quiet, and unorthodox ways. Oftentimes, just because Aquarius chooses to take the path less traveled, the results of their eccentric methods are surprisingly effective. They are the humanitarians of the zodiac, taking up banners for the greater good of humanity. Many of them are also easy going and their peculiarity alongside their curious nature make them fast friendships. Sometimes, if they don't strive to motivate themselves, they can succumb to laziness. Many are often gifted with a strong sense of art and poetry.
</p>
<br><br><br>
<a name="Pisces">PISCES</a>
<br>
<img src="https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/002/094/813/original/pisces-zodiac-sign-icons-vector.jpg" width="500">
<p align="justify">
The Pisces zodiac sign are the dreamers and mystics of the zodiac - but you may never know it. Many of them have extremely vivid inner lives - filled with fantasy, magic and wonder. They may find it hard to express that inner life, meaning that many of them are introverts. They are honest, compassionate, and trustworthy but they can sometimes take it too far and be rather gullible. Because of that they can be taken advantage of. Beneath their quiet exterior, Pisces has an intense determination, which helps them transcend any obstacles that come their way.
